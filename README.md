# Basic Mouse Aim Trainer

## By Alexander Jacobson (66453994)

As the title suggests, this application will help a user improve their aim
with a mouse. It will create a blank screen, and one or multiple "targets" 
(small circles) will appear at a random locations on the screen. When the 
user clicks a target, it will disappear and a new one will appear at a 
different random location. It is the user's job to click these targets as 
fast as possible as they appear. If the user "misses" the target, it will 
stay on the screen until it is clicked. The game will continue until a 
certain number of targets (100 by default) are clicked, or the user ends 
the game early.

Anyone who is interested in improving at video games (particularly, 
first-person shooters) may be interested in using this application. My main
motivations behind this project are my own interests in video games, and my
frustrations with existing aim trainers. Most aim trainers either have very
limited customizability, or put strain on a user's computer. My vision is to 
create an aim trainer that is straightforward to use, doesn't take much cpu 
or memory, and can easily be customized to suit a user's wants. Some of the 
ways this application can be customized (more to come) are listed in the 
user stories below.

As a user, I want to be able to:
- Start a new game with a specified number of targets on screen
- Remove a target from the screen by clicking it
- **Manually add a target to the screen at any point in the game**
- Clear the screen and end the game early
- See my target accuracy on the screen (targets hit/times clicked)
- Control the size of the targets that appear on the screen
- Control the shape of the targets
- Control the total number of targets that must be clicked for the game to end
- Enable/disable movement of targets (in random directions)
- Control where targets can appear on the screen
